# Why Study JavaScript?

* HTML to define the content of web pages.
* CSS to specify the layout of web pages.
* JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages.

Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.
